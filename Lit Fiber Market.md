<p data-start="112" data-end="616">The global lit fiber market was valued at USD 4.90 billion in 2024 and is expected to experience substantial growth, reaching USD 18.63 billion by 2033. The market is projected to grow at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033. <strong><a href="https://straitsresearch.com/report/lit-fiber-market">Lit fiber</a></strong>, a type of optical fiber that is already operational for providing internet and network services, is becoming increasingly essential for telecommunications and data centers, driving the demand for this market.</p>
<p data-start="618" data-end="639"><strong data-start="618" data-end="639">Market Definition</strong></p>
<p data-start="641" data-end="1151">Lit fiber refers to optical fiber infrastructure that is already in use to provide internet connectivity, communication networks, and data transmission services. Unlike dark fiber, which is unused fiber-optic infrastructure, lit fiber is activated, meaning the fibers are already connected to transmission equipment and are operational. This fiber infrastructure is crucial for telecom companies, data centers, and cloud service providers, as it offers high-speed, high-capacity data transmission capabilities.</p>
